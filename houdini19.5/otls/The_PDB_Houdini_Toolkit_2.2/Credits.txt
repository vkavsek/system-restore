Hi Everyone .

Here are the people you can thank for making this toolset happen.

First off, the entire Gridmarkets team. 
If Mark and Rosa hadn't talked me into looking into the science rotue, 
I probably would have never decided to work with proteins.

They also had access to an amazing team of scientists for me to bounce questions off of. Which was fantastic. 
Thank you all for tolerating me and being open minded.

Thanks to Michael Drummond, Adam Ferestad, Mark Ross, Adam Katz, Christopher Rutledage, and Rosa Altimiras.

If you would like to learn from the pros , then I highly recomend these webincars of the basics of protein folding.
