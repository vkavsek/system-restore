Hi Everyone .

Thanks for downloading this toolset.

The plan is to keep this toolkit open source so Houdini can be used more in protein renders. 
Currently building the toolkit in Houdini LC untill I am happy with the toolkit. Rather get all the kinks worked out and then 
make a commerical version, than waste money and time. 

So far this toolet is in its V.2.2 Build and the wish list is for this as follows:

- Allow for more accurate animations 
- Better Animation and folding for proteins overall
- Covalent Bond Visualizer HDA
- Custom Materials for Mantra and Karma
- HDAs with better protein folding solves.
- Polarity visualziation
- Atomic Bond Visualization
- CVS file handing/importing
- Density Solve Checker
- DOFs Solver and Visualizer
- Water Molecule Isolation


So far this toolkit can build your standard ball and stick/wireframe models, spacefilling diagrams, and ribbon models. As well as:

-Rough animation techniques through noise.
-Creation of wireframe models
-Isolation of Carbon/Oxygen/Nitrogen elements
-Creation of Space filling Diagrams
-Creation of Ribbon Diagrams
-Correct count of Atoms, Elements per Amino acid, and Chains.
-Better Wireframe, Space filling, and Ribbon creation
-Better isolation and visualization of Amino acids.
-Animation using temperature factor HDAs
-Chain isolation HDAs
-Functions for working with open and closed virus proteins.  
- HDAs for visualizing sequences, Ribonucleotides, and Deoxyribonucleotides
- Application of atomic properites

Let me know if you have an suggestions!
